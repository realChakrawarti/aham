## Expression
Any unit of code that can be evaluated to a value is an expression.
- Arithmetic Expressions: `10;`, `10+54;`
- String Expression: `'hello' + 'world';`
- Logical Expression: `54 > 45`; // outputs boolean value
- Primary Expression: `true;`, `'hello, world!'` // standalone expression such as literal values
- Left-hand-side Expression: `i = 10;`, `let myObj = {};`
- Assignment Expression: `let value = 10;` // note, declaration is not part of an expression, so in `let value = 10;` let is not part of the expression
 

## Statement
A statement is an instruction to perform a specific action. Such actions include creating a variable or a function, looping through an array of elements, evaluating code based on a specific condition etc. JavaScript programs are actually a sequence of statements.
 

- Declaration Statements: `var sum;`, `var average`, `var total = 0` (`var total` is a statement, and `total = 10` is an assignment expression), function declaration is a statement.
- Conditional Statements: These executes based on the value of an expression.

```js
if (expression) {
	statement 1
} else {
	statement 2
}
```  
 

### Expression Statements
Wherever JavaScript expects a statement, you can also write an expression. Such statements are referred to as expression statements. But the reverse does not hold. You cannot use a statement in the place of an expression.
 

- `var a = var b;` // error, statement in place of an expression
- `var a = (b = 1);` // since b = 1 is an assignment expression so acceptable
- `console.log(var a);` // error, can only pass expressions as an argument in a function

### Function Expressions vs Function Declarations

#### Function Expression
A function declaration is part of variable assignment expression.
It may contain name(named function expression) or may not(anonymous function)
Since this type of function comes after `=` hence it is evaluated as an expression.

```js
let msg = function message(text) {
    console.log(text);
}

msg('hello');

// Anonymous function:

let msg = function (text) {
    console.log(text);
}

msg('hola');
``` 

Only function expression can be immendiately invoked and are referred to as Immediately Invoked Function Expression (**IIFE**).

```js
(function () {
    'use strict';
    console.log('Immediately Invoked Function Expression');
})();
```

#### Function Declaration
Function declaration falls under declaration statement as they perform the action of creating a variable whose value is that of the function.
Function declaration must be named and are hoisted to the top.

```js
function greet(msg) {
    console.log('Hi ' + msg + '!');
}

greet('everyone ðŸ‘‹');
```
